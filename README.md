ask:   implement an online chatting system using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/AJAX based on a given simplified sample code.
Functionality:  The system works like this. 
1. when you connect to chat site, you will see the logon page like this [User Name, Password Entry Fields]
2. after logon, you will see this page with your name and your friends [Page with central portion that has all friends names]
3. if you click any friend, you can start chatting with this friend.
Requirement:
1. on server,  user/friends/chatting log information can be saved either in file system or database.
2. user cannot logon on more than once at the same time, so if "your name" has logon,  when you open another browser, you will not be automatically logged on, you will still be prompt with logon form, so that you can logon on as another user. or if try to logon  as "your name", you are not allowed. 
3. write comment for your code to explain your intention.
4. based on the sample code provided.

Optional functions
1. add new friends
2. showing you have new message from certain friend.
3. any other function you like


Basically, have to use the base code provided and implement a chat functionality so if we logon to the system from two different browsers as two different users, you can chat between both the users.  Password and Usernames can be pre-defined. We can use filesystems or can use MySQL for storage of information.
